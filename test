Step-by-Step: Why Use Background Subtraction to Detect Motion?
When detecting motion (like cars on a road), we want to find what is moving in each frame.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
Video = many images shown quickly

A video is just many frames (images) shown one after another.

In most frames, the background (road, trees) stays the same.

Only moving objects (cars, people) change.

Goal: Find what’s different (moving) between frames.

Background Subtraction does this:

It learns the static background (like the road).

Then it subtracts the background from each new frame.

What’s left? Only the moving objects.


What Haar Cascade Algorithm Does:
The Haar Cascade algorithm is a machine learning–based object detection method used to detect objects in images or videos, such as faces, cars, or people.

How It Works (Simple Terms):
Loads a pretrained model (from an XML file, like cars.xml or haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml).

Scans the image at different scales and positions.

Tries to match the object patterns using Haar-like features (like edges, lines, rectangles).

If it finds a match, it returns the coordinates of the object (x, y, width, height).

You can then draw a rectangle around it.
