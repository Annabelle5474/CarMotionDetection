Step-by-Step: Why Use Background Subtraction to Detect Motion?
When detecting motion (like cars on a road), we want to find what is moving in each frame.

✅ Step-by-Step Explanation:
Video = many images shown quickly

A video is just many frames (images) shown one after another.

In most frames, the background (road, trees) stays the same.

Only moving objects (cars, people) change.

Goal: Find what’s different (moving) between frames.

Background Subtraction does this:

It learns the static background (like the road).

Then it subtracts the background from each new frame.

What’s left? Only the moving objects.
